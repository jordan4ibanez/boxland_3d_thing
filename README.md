I wanted to see if I could immitate 3D arcade style driving with point based collision detection.


Listen, I say I don't know what I'm doing in my other repos as a joke.

But this time, I literally have NO IDEA what I'm doing.

This needs glfw 3.4 which ubuntu 24.04 and fedora 41 do not ship so they're unsupported. If your distro hasn't updated to glfw 3.4 it's unsupported. 

uses Jolt Physics through a C binding lol.
